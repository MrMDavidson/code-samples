# Code Samples #

This is a collection of code samples that I reference from elsewhere. These are not guarenteed to be production ready and for demonstration purposes only

## [FindDominantColour](./FindDominantColour) ##

This example uses [K Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to determine the dominant colours in an image. Can be used for automatic theming.
